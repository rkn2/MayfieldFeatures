# Why RFE was NOT implemented in the Final Methodology

After conducting an exploratory Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) pass at the 14-feature level, the study explicitly decided to maintain the **Permutation Importance + SHAP** approach without a hard RFE downselect. The reasons are as follows:

### 1. Preservation vs. Prediction
RFE is an efficiency-driven method meant to create the leannest possible predictive model. In historic preservation, the goal is **explanation**. RFE often discards physically significant features (like "Parapet Height") if they are statistically redundant with others (like "Wall Slenderness"). For engineering assessment, we need to see all potential failure points, even if they correlate.

### 2. Handling Collinearity as Signal
Historic buildings exhibit natural collinearity (e.g., construction era often dictates material choice). RFE tends to keep only one feature from a correlated group. Our current method of using **Statistical Tiers** correctly reflects the "physical reality" that vulnerability is driven by a broad constellation of interdependent defects acting in concert.

### 3. Stability in Low-Sample Classes
RFE is highly sensitive to model performance. Because the "Low Damage" class is rare (11%), RFE risks prematurely discarding the subtle features that define the critical "transition zone" where preservation interventions are most effective.

### 4. Cross-Method Consensus
By keeping all features and comparing Permutation Importance with SHAP, we identify features that rank highly across both methods. This consensus provides a higher level of confidence for engineering recommenations than an iterative elimination process.

**Summary:** The RFE exploratory results confirmed that our engineered features were stable, but the method was deemed too reductive for the complex, explanatory needs of historic structural pathology.
