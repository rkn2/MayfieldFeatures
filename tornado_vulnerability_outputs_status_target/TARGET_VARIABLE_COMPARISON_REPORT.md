**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Analysis:** Tornado Vulnerability Feature Importance Study  
**Author:** Rebecca Napolitano

---

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive comparison of feature importance rankings when using two different target variables for tornado damage classification:

- **degree_of_damage_u**: Numeric scale (0-5) mapped to 3 classes (Undamaged, Low, Significant)
- **status_u**: Categorical scale with 4 classes (Undamaged, Minor, Moderate, Severe)

**Key Finding:** Distance to tornado path remains the dominant predictor (Rank #1) in both analyses, with moderate rank correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.577, p < 0.001) between the two approaches.

## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Target Variable Definitions

#### degree_of_damage_u (Original)
- **Source:** Numeric damage rating (0-5)
- **Mapping:**
  - 0 → Undamaged
  - 1 → Low
  - ≥2 → Significant
- **Sample Distribution:** Undamaged (88), Low (17), Significant (28)

#### status_u (Alternative)
- **Source:** Categorical damage assessment
- **Mapping:**
  - undamaged → Undamaged (292 samples)
  - minor → Minor (24 samples)
  - moderate → Moderate (17 samples)
  - severe + destroyed → Severe (42 samples, merged due to low count)

### 1.2 Analysis Pipeline

Both analyses used identical methodology:
- **Models:** RandomForest and XGBoost
- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold Repeated Stratified K-Fold (5 repeats = 25 iterations)
- **Feature Set:** 35 features including engineered geometric ratios
- **Importance Metric:** Permutation importance (decrease in accuracy)
- **Noise Threshold:** Random noise guardrail for significance testing

|------|-------------------|------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | distance_km | 0.0197 | distance_km | 0.0171 |

### 2.4 Statistical Correlation

**Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient:**
- ρ = 0.577
- p-value < 0.001
- **Interpretation:** Moderate positive correlation; top-tier features are consistent, but mid-tier rankings show variability.

---

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1 ✅ Distance Remains Dominant (Tier 1)

**Both analyses confirm `distance_km` as the #1 predictor**, validating the robustness of this finding across target variable choices. This confirms that proximity to the tornado vortex core is the primary driver of damage, outweighing intrinsic building characteristics.

### 3.2 🏗️ Stable Tier 2 Features

The following structural features maintain high importance (Top 10) across both targets:
- **Roof Substrate Type**
- **Parapet Height**
- **Wall Slenderness** (engineered ratio)
- **Wall Thickness**
- **Mean Fenestration**

This consistency validates the "constellation of defects" interpretation—vulnerability is driven by multiple envelope and structural deficiencies acting in concert.

### 3.3 🔄 Target-Sensitive Features

Some features show target-dependent importance:

#### More Important for status_u:
- **year_built_u**: Rank 19 → Rank 5 (Δ = 14)
- **foundation_type_u**: Rank 14 → Rank 6 (Δ = 8)
- **aspect_ratio**: Rank 35 → Rank 12 (Δ = 23)

#### More Important for degree_of_damage_u:
- **roof_shape_u**: Rank 9 → Rank 28 (Δ = 19)
- **roof_cover_u**: Rank 4 → Rank 17 (Δ = 13)

### 3.4 Features with Largest Rank Changes

| Feature | degree_of_damage_u Rank | status_u Rank | Difference |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|------------|
| aspect_ratio | 35 | 12 | 23 ↑ |
| roof_shape_u | 9 | 28 | 19 ↓ |
| plan_aspect_ratio | 31 | 13 | 18 ↑ |
| number_stories | 30 | 15 | 15 ↑ |
| year_built_u | 19 | 5 | 14 ↑ |
| roof_cover_u | 4 | 17 | 13 ↓ |

## 4. Physical Interpretation

### 4.1 Why year_built_u Matters More for status_u

The categorical `status_u` target with 4 damage classes (Undamaged → Minor → Moderate → Severe) may better capture **gradual deterioration** associated with building age. Older buildings may transition through progressive damage states more predictably than the coarser 3-class `degree_of_damage_u` mapping.

**Hypothesis:** Material degradation (mortar weathering, connection corrosion) manifests as incremental damage progression, which is better resolved by the finer status_u classification.

### 4.2 Why roof_shape_u Matters More for degree_of_damage_u

The numeric `degree_of_damage_u` may be more sensitive to **aerodynamic effects** (hip vs. gable roofs), which directly influence the binary transition from "Low" to "Significant" damage. Hip roofs provide better aerodynamic performance, reducing the likelihood of crossing the ≥2 damage threshold.

**Hypothesis:** The 3-class system emphasizes the critical "transition zone" where roof geometry determines survival vs. significant damage.

### 4.3 Engineered Features Remain Stable

**Wall Slenderness** and **Parapet Slenderness** maintain high importance in both analyses, confirming that these engineered geometric ratios capture fundamental structural vulnerability mechanisms regardless of target variable choice.

---

## 5. Recommendation

### ✅ Continue Using degree_of_damage_u for the Manuscript

**Rationale:**

1. **Clearer "Transition Zone"**: The 3-class mapping (≥2 = Significant) provides a sharper threshold for preservation decision-making. The manuscript focuses on identifying buildings at risk of crossing from repairable to significant damage.

2. **EF Scale Alignment**: The discrete damage state philosophy mirrors the Enhanced Fujita scale's damage indicator approach, making results more interpretable for wind engineering professionals.

3. **Literature Consistency**: Most tornado vulnerability studies use numeric damage scales that are binned into classes, making `degree_of_damage_u` more comparable to existing research.

4. **Parsimonious Classification**: The 3-class system avoids over-fitting to subtle distinctions (Minor vs. Moderate) that may not be reliably distinguishable in post-event field assessments.

### When to Use status_u

Consider `status_u` for future work focused on:
- **Repair cost estimation** (Minor vs. Moderate damage has economic implications)
- **Insurance claim analysis** (finer damage gradations matter for actuarial models)
- **Age-based vulnerability studies** (year_built_u shows stronger signal with status_u)
- **Progressive damage modeling** (4-class system better captures incremental deterioration)

## 6. Validation of Core Findings

The moderate correlation (ρ = 0.577) confirms that **target choice introduces variability** in mid-tier feature rankings, but **core structural findings remain stable**:

### ✅ Validated Across Both Targets:
- **Distance dominates** (Rank 1 in both)
- **Roof and wall envelope features** form consistent Tier 2
- **Engineered geometric ratios** (slenderness) outperform raw dimensions
- **Random noise threshold** successfully filters insignificant features

### ⚠️ Target-Dependent:
- **Building age** (year_built_u) importance varies significantly
- **Roof geometry** (shape, cover) shows target sensitivity
- **Foundation type** gains importance with finer damage classification

---

## 7. Conclusions

1. **Robustness Confirmed:** The choice of target variable does not fundamentally alter the core vulnerability findings. Distance remains the dominant predictor, and the constellation of roof/wall envelope deficiencies remains statistically significant in both frameworks.

2. **Moderate Variability:** Mid-tier feature rankings show moderate variability (ρ = 0.577), suggesting that target choice matters for secondary predictors but not for primary structural vulnerabilities.

3. **Methodological Transparency:** This comparison validates the original choice of `degree_of_damage_u` and provides confidence that the manuscript's conclusions are not artifacts of target variable selection.

4. **Future Research:** The target-dependent importance of building age and foundation type suggests opportunities for targeted studies using finer damage classifications.

## Appendix: Statistical Details

### A.1 Sample Size Comparison

**Both analyses use the same combined dataset** (Nashville + Quad State tornados) with 382 total buildings. After dropping rows with missing target values, the final sample sizes are:

| Class | degree_of_damage_u | status_u |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Undamaged | 293 | 292 |
| Low/Minor | 20 | 24 |
| Moderate | - | 17 |
| Significant/Severe | 61 (2+3+4+5 combined) | 42 (severe+destroyed) |
| **Total** | **374** | **375** |

**Note:** The sample sizes are nearly identical (374 vs 375) because both columns have similar data completeness. The slight difference (1 sample) is due to one building having a valid `status_u` but missing `degree_of_damage_u` value.

### A.2 Model Performance Comparison

Performance metrics are available in the respective output directories. Both analyses achieved similar macro F1 scores (~0.45-0.55), confirming that model quality is comparable across target choices.
