# Target Variable Comparison: degree_of_damage_u vs. status_u

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares feature importance rankings when using two different target variables:
- **degree_of_damage_u**: Numeric scale (0-5) mapped to 3 classes (Undamaged, Low, Significant)
- **status_u**: Categorical scale with 4 classes (Undamaged, Minor, Moderate, Severe)

## Key Findings

### 1. Distance Remains Dominant Predictor
**Distance to tornado path (distance_km) ranks #1 in both analyses**, confirming its robustness as the primary vulnerability factor regardless of target variable choice.

- degree_of_damage_u: Mean importance = 0.0197
- status_u: Mean importance = 0.0171

### 2. Moderate Rank Correlation
**Spearman's ρ = 0.577 (p < 0.001)**

This indicates moderate agreement between the two ranking systems. While the top-tier features are generally consistent, there are notable differences in mid-tier rankings.

### 4. Features with Largest Rank Changes

| Feature | degree_of_damage_u Rank | status_u Rank | Difference |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|------------|
| aspect_ratio | 35 | 12 | 23 |
| roof_shape_u | 9 | 28 | 19 |
| plan_aspect_ratio | 31 | 13 | 18 |
| number_stories | 30 | 15 | 15 |
| year_built_u | 19 | 5 | 14 |

## Interpretation

### Consistent Findings (Tier 1)
The following features maintain high importance across both targets:
- **Distance** (hazard exposure)
- **Roof Substrate Type**
- **Parapet Height**
- **Wall Slenderness**
- **Wall Thickness**

### Target-Sensitive Features
Some features show target-dependent importance:

**More important for status_u:**
- **year_built_u**: Jumps from Rank 19 → Rank 5
- **foundation_type_u**: Jumps from Rank 14 → Rank 6
- **aspect_ratio**: Jumps from Rank 35 → Rank 12

**More important for degree_of_damage_u:**
- **roof_shape_u**: Drops from Rank 9 → Rank 28
- **roof_cover_u**: Drops from Rank 4 → Rank 17

## Physical Interpretation

### Why year_built_u Matters More for status_u
The categorical status_u target may better capture **gradual deterioration** associated with building age. Older buildings may transition through Minor → Moderate → Severe more predictably than the coarser 3-class degree_of_damage_u mapping.

### Why roof_shape_u Matters More for degree_of_damage_u
The numeric degree_of_damage_u may be more sensitive to **aerodynamic effects** (hip vs. gable roofs), which directly influence the binary transition from "Low" to "Significant" damage.

## Recommendation

### For the Current Manuscript
**Continue using degree_of_damage_u** for the following reasons:

1. **Alignment with EF Scale Logic**: The 3-class system (Undamaged, Low, Significant) mirrors the EF damage indicator philosophy of discrete damage states.

2. **Clearer "Transition Zone"**: The manuscript focuses on the critical threshold where buildings move from repairable to significant damage. The degree_of_damage_u mapping (≥2 = Significant) provides a cleaner cut-off than status_u's 4-class gradation.

3. **Consistency with Literature**: Most tornado vulnerability studies use numeric damage scales that are then binned into classes, making degree_of_damage_u more comparable to existing research.

### When to Use status_u
Consider status_u for future work focused on:
- **Repair cost estimation** (Minor vs. Moderate matters economically)
- **Insurance claim analysis** (finer damage gradations)
- **Age-based vulnerability studies** (year_built_u shows stronger signal)

## Statistical Validation

The moderate correlation (ρ = 0.577) confirms that **target choice does influence feature rankings**, but the core structural findings remain stable:
- Distance dominates
- Roof and wall envelope features form Tier 2
- Engineered geometric ratios (slenderness) outperform raw dimensions

## Conclusion

The choice of target variable introduces **moderate variability** in mid-tier feature rankings but does not fundamentally alter the core vulnerability findings. **Distance remains the dominant predictor**, and the constellation of roof/wall envelope deficiencies remains statistically significant in both frameworks.
